This Shiny app is designed to support interactive visualization and analysis of biological data, featuring customized plotting functions, guided interactivity, and additional utilities.

**Main App**
- shiny_vis.R: Entry point that sources all required scripts and runs the app.
- ui.R: Defines the user interface layout and widgets.
- server.R: Contains server-side logic, rendering outputs, and handling reactive expressions.

**Plotting Logic**
- major_plot_function.r: Main plotting logic and reusable plot functions.
- plot_shiny.r: Shiny-specific plotting helpers for dynamic visualization.
- dependent_bw.r: Functions for visualizing dependencies (possibly box/violin plots).
- dependent_2.R: Alternate or extended version of the above, possibly testing different layouts or plot types.

**Temporary App for BAM only**
- dev_app.R
- dev_ui.R
- dev_server.R

**Pending Integration**
select_dire.R

**To-Do**
[ ] Merge select_dire.R into the main app for directory selection.
[ ] Clean unused code or consolidate similar functions (dependent_bw.r vs dependent_2.R).
